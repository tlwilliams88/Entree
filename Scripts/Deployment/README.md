# Entree Service Reinstall Scripts

* Very specific locations needed. Tweak the variables to fit what is needed
* Need to be run on the machine the upgrade is happening on.

## Issues

* Need to flesh out the config backup portion. Not ideal and likes to throw fits.
* Look into grabbing installers from universal package location somewhere. 
* Combine scripts/parameterize it so it's more universal.
