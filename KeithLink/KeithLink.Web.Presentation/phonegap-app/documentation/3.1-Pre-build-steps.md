# Pre-build steps

1. Download the latest code from git and switch to the correct branch
  - ```develop``` - building latest code for test
  - ```RC``` - building QA code for review
  - ```master``` - building prod code for prod
2. Run ```grunt update```. This does 3 things.
  - Pulls all the code from the angular-app directory into the phonegap-app directory except for the ```scripts/services/phonegapServices/``` directory.
  - Compiles sass files
  - Replaces certain text in the ```index.html``` and ```app.js``` files using the ```grunt-replace``` plugin.
