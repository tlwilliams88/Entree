# Pre-build steps

1. Download the latest code from git and switch to the correct branch
  - ```develop``` - building latest code for test
  - ```RC``` - building QA code for review
  - ```master``` - building prod code for prod
2. Run ```grunt update```
  - This pulls all the code from the angular-app directory into the phonegap-app directory except for the ```scripts/services/phonegapServices/``` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the [AfterGruntUpdate.txt](3.2-AfterGruntUpdate.txt) file to update the ```www/index.html``` file correctly
