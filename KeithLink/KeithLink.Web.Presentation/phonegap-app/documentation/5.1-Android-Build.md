# Build

[Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/)

1. Follow the [Pre-build steps]()

## For development

1. Run ```grunt build:android:review```
2. ```grunt phonegap:run:android:emulator```

The ```.apk``` is located in the ```build/platforms/android/build/apk``` if needed.

## Build the apk

1. Run ```grunt build:android:review``` or ```grunt build:android:prod```
2. In the build.gradle file(generated during build process) under the heading Android{}, should be line 269:
lintOptions {
	checkReleaseBuilds false
}
3. In Terminal, navigate to the cordova folder in the android build ```phonegap-app/BEKPhoneGap/build/platforms/android/cordova```
4. Run ```cordova build android --debug``` (or ```--release```). The apk file will be located at the following location at phonegap-app/BEKPhoneGap/build/platforms/android/build/apk

## For deploying to the Google Play Store

Steps were taken from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26449512/how-to-create-singed-apk-file-using-cordova-command-line-interface) StackOverflow question

1. Set the next version number(ex. 1.0.2) and the version code(ex. 10006000) in the _config.xml file. Versions ending in odd numbers point to the QA api and even numbers point to the Prod api.
2. Follow the steps under "Build the apk" and use the ```--release``` option for Step #3
3. Navigate up to the ```BEKPhoneGap/``` directory. You should see the myrelease.keystore there.
4. Sign the apk with the keystore. ```jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore myrelease.keystore build/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk benekeith-entree-prod```. The keystore pass word is **bek12345**
5. Navigate to ```build/platforms/android/build/apk``` directory
6. Rename the file with ```zipalign -v 4 android-release-unsigned.apk BEKEntree.apk```
7. Now you can upload the BEKEntree.apk file to Google Play
