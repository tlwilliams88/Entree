## For deploying to the Google Play Store

Steps were taken from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26449512/how-to-create-singed-apk-file-using-cordova-command-line-interface) StackOverflow question

1. Follow the steps under Build the apk and use the ```--release``` option for Step #3
2. Navigate to the ```ant-build/``` directory
3. Generate a keystore using whatever keystore name and alias name you wish ```keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key>.keystore -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000```
4. You will be prompted to answer several questions and create a password. Use the password **bek12345** and the following answers from the screenshot.

5. You should see the new .keystore file in the cordova directory
6. Sign the apk ```jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore CordovaApp-release-unsigned.apk alias_name```. You will be prompted for the keystore passphrase
7. Rename the file ```zipalign -v 4 CordovaApp-release-unsigned.apk BEKEntree.apk```
8. Now you can upload the BEKEntree.apk file to Google Play
